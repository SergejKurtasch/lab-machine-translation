what an unthrift in the world doth spend\\r\\nShifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;\\r\\nBut beauty‚Äôs waste hath in the world an end,\\r\\nAnd kept unused the user so destroys it.\\r\\n    No love toward others in that bosom sits\\r\\n    That on himself such murd‚Äôrous shame commits.\\r\\n\\r\\nX\\r\\n\\r\\nFor shame! deny that thou bear‚Äôst love to any,\\r\\nWho for thyself art so unprovident.\\r\\nGrant, if thou wilt, thou art belov‚Äôd of many,\\r\\nBut that thou none lov‚Äôst is most evident:\\r\\nFor thou art so possess‚Äôd with murderous hate,\\r\\nThat ‚Äôgainst thyself thou stick‚Äôst not to conspire,\\r\\nSeeking that beauteous roof to ruinate\\r\\nWhich to repair should be thy chief desire.\\r\\nO! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:\\r\\nShall hate be fairer lodg‚Äôd than gentle love?\\r\\nBe, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,\\r\\nOr to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:\\r\\n    Make thee another self for love of me,\\r\\n    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nXI\\r\\n\\r\\nAs fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow‚Äôst,\\r\\nIn one of thine, from that which thou departest;\\r\\nAnd that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow‚Äôst,\\r\\nThou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,\\r\\nHerein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;\\r\\nWithout this folly, age, and cold decay:\\r\\nIf all were minded so, the times should cease\\r\\nAnd threescore year would make the world away.\\r\\nLet those whom nature hath not made for store,\\r\\nHarsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:\\r\\nLook, whom she best endow‚Äôd, she gave thee more;\\r\\nWhich bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:\\r\\n    She carv‚Äôd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,\\r\\n    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.\\r\\n\\r\\nXII\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I do count the clock that tells the time,\\r\\nAnd see the brave day sunk in hideous night;\\r\\nWhen I behold the violet past prime,\\r\\nAnd sable curls, all silvered o‚Äôer with white;\\r\\nWhen lofty trees I see barren of leaves,\\r\\nWhich erst from heat did canopy the herd,\\r\\nAnd summer‚Äôs green all girded up in sheaves,\\r\\nBorne on the bier with white and bristly beard,\\r\\nThen of thy beauty do I question make,\\r\\nThat thou among the wastes of time must go,\\r\\nSince sweets and beauties do themselves forsake\\r\\nAnd die as fast as they see others grow;\\r\\n    And nothing ‚Äôgainst Time‚Äôs scythe can make defence\\r\\n    Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.\\r\\n\\r\\nXIII\\r\\n\\r\\nO! that you were your self; but, love you are\\r\\nNo longer yours, than you yourself here live:\\r\\nAgainst this coming end you should prepare,\\r\\nAnd your sweet semblance to some other give:\\r\\nSo should that beauty which you hold in lease\\r\\nFind no determination; then you were\\r\\nYourself again, after yourself‚Äôs decease,\\r\\nWhen your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.\\r\\nWho lets so fair a house fall to decay,\\r\\nWhich husbandry in honour might uphold,\\r\\nAgainst the stormy gusts of winter‚Äôs day\\r\\nAnd barren rage of death‚Äôs eternal cold?\\r\\n    O! none but unthrifts.

rest.\\r\\nIn me thou see‚Äôst the glowing of such fire,\\r\\nThat on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\\r\\nAs the death-bed, whereon it must expire,\\r\\nConsum‚Äôd with that which it was nourish‚Äôd by.\\r\\n    This thou perceiv‚Äôst, which makes thy love more strong,\\r\\n    To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXIV\\r\\n\\r\\nBut be contented: when that fell

review\\r\\nThe very part was consecrate to thee:\\r\\nThe earth can have but earth, which is his due;\\r\\nMy spirit is thine, the better part of me:\\r\\nSo then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,\\r\\nThe prey of worms, my body being dead;\\r\\nThe coward conquest of a wretch‚Äôs knife,\\r\\nToo base of thee to be remembered.\\r\\n    The worth of that is that which it contains,\\r\\n    And that is this, and this with thee remains.\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXV\\r\\n\\r\\nSo are you to my thoughts as food to life,\\r\\nOr as sweet-season‚Äôd showers are to the ground;\\r\\nAnd for the peace of you

you alone,\\r\\nThen better‚Äôd that the world may see my pleasure:\\r\\nSometime all full with feasting on your sight,\\r\\nAnd by and by clean starved for a look;\\r\\nPossessing or pursuing no

barren of new pride,\\r\\nSo far from variation or quick change?\\r\\nWhy with the time do I not glance aside\\r\\nTo new-found methods, and to compounds strange?\\r\\nWhy write I still all one, ever the same,\\r\\nAnd keep invention in a noted weed,\\r\\nThat every word doth almost tell my name,\\r\\nShowing their birth, and where they did proceed?\\r\\nO! know sweet love I always write of you,\\r\\nAnd you and love are still my argument;\\r\\nSo all my best is dressing old words new,\\r\\nSpending again what is already spent:\\r\\n    For as the sun is daily new and old,\\r\\n    So is my love still telling what is told.\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXVII\\r\\n\\r\\nThy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,\\r\\nThy dial how thy precious minutes waste;\\r\\nThese vacant leaves thy mind‚Äôs
